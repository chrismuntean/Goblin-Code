# Goblin Code
### My project for Missouri Hacks 2024 Competition

## How to play
* Use WASD to move
* Space to shoot </> bullets

## Goal
* Get the highest score possible by shooting the error messages with HTML tags!
* Avoid getting hit by the error messages or you will lose a life!
* When you see a green "Git commit" grab it to add an extra life
